# 🧠 bare-ml

A minimalist machine learning library built from first principles.  
The goal is to **demystify ML algorithms** with clean, transparent code rooted directly in theory — ideal for learning, experimentation, and academic use.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

> **bare-ml** is built to help **college students and beginners** understand how machine learning algorithms work at the deepest level — no black boxes, no hidden magic.

With minimal abstractions and carefully structured logic, it supports a growing collection of ML algorithms written the way they are taught:  
**step-by-step, mathematically grounded, and intuitive.**

## ✅ Key Features

- 📦 Lightweight and dependency-free  
- 📘 Theory-aligned implementations of ML models  
- 🔁 Supports batch & stochastic training  
- 💡 Helpful for coursework, prototyping, and self-learning  
- 📚 Educationally focused code comments and structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bare-ml.git
cd bare-ml

# Create virtual environment (name it .venv or venv)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Now install your dependencies
pip install -r requirement.txt

# start the program
python main.py
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Example Usage

```python
from regression import linear_regression

model = linear_regression(x_train, y_train)
model.train(epochs=100)
print(model.predict(x_test))
```
